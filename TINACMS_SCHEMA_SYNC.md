# TinaCMS Schema Sync Status

## Current Status: WAITING FOR TINACLOUD INDEXING

The build script has been temporarily modified to skip cloud checks while TinaCloud indexes the new schema.

### Current Build Command:
```json
"build": "tinacms build --skip-cloud-checks && vite build"
```

### When TinaCloud Finishes Indexing:

1. Check if schema is synced:
   ```bash
   npx tinacms build
   ```

2. If successful (no schema mismatch), revert build command to:
   ```json
   "build": "tinacms build && vite build"
   ```

3. Commit and push the change:
   ```bash
   git add package.json
   git commit -m "Revert build script: TinaCloud schema sync complete"
   git push origin main
   ```

### New Collections Added:
- Contact Section (contact)
- Footer (footer) 
- Site Settings (siteSettings)

### Schema Changes:
- Added Contact type
- Added Footer type  
- Added SiteSettings type
- All with proper field definitions

Once TinaCloud indexing is complete, all new collections will be available in the admin interface.
