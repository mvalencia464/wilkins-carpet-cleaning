In the past I have been using home carpet cleaners for forever, and they don't work very good and I really had lost hope. I was contemplating replacing the carpets!! Anthony did his magic and they have NEVER looked so good! I had a stain on the carpet in my daughter's room that I scrubbed myself. I could never get up. It is gone!! Thank you, Anthony. I appreciate all your hard work and dedication to doing your job to superior status! Well done!! ü§©",

He recently cleaned a carpet that I thought would have to be replaced, but after his work was done, I was literally blown away! During my evening talk after work, I bragged about him to my husband. My husband said, he must CARE about what he does and I agreed. He assess the work, he keeps everything in order, he's prompt and efficient, very personable and most important, he's honest.",

However, Wilkins made it look new. I couldn't believe it, my mom was very pleased!! I would definitely recommend Wilkins going forward for all of her carpet cleaning. It's a very professional & thorough carpet cleaning company.",

The first time he cleaned my carpet I was in labor at the hospital. Mr. Wilkins cleaned my carpet and noticed that I had air filters I meant to change before leaving unexpectedly. He went over and beyond by taking out and replacing my filters. He has superb customer service and I will be back again!!!!!",
